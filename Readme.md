# VeilCircuit

> *"Where signals disappear into silence."*

**VeilCircuit** is a stealth-layer proxy orchestration stack designed for privacy, misdirection, and multistage obfuscation. Deployable with Docker, it routes your traffic through an encrypted Shadowsocks tunnel, behind a reverse proxy (NGINX), and optionally wraps it inside a Tor hidden service.

---

## 🔐 Features

- 🌐 **Shadowsocks** obfuscation layer to encrypt client traffic
- 🔄 **NGINX Reverse Proxy** to relay traffic to internal services
- 🧅 **Tor Hidden Service** support for deep anonymity
- 📦 Fully containerized via Docker Compose
- ☁️ Ready for VPS deployment, car hotspot, or disposable edge node

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xosski/Codename-VeilCircuit.git
   cd VeilCircuit
2. Spin up the stack:
docker-compose up -d
3. Connect using shadowsocks:
Address: your-server-ip
Port: 8388
Password: supersecret
Encryption: aes-256-gcm
⚙️ Configuration
nginx.conf — controls reverse proxy logic

docker-compose.yml — manages containers and volumes

torrc (optional) — enables .onion service from within container

certs/ — mount your own SSL certs if using HTTPS

🌐 Optional Tor Access
To enable Tor hidden service:

Ensure torrc is present.

Mount it in the tor service container.

Retrieve the .onion hostname from the container logs or volume.

⚠️ Notes
This is a stealth-layer routing utility — not a VPN.

For real anonymity, rotate endpoints and monitor timing patterns.
